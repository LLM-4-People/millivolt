# Protocol and client integration

millivolt accepts OpenAI-compatible requests and routes them using per-request
headers. It does not require an endpoint/API-key registry. Read
[Security](../SECURITY.md): routing credentials do not authorize operator access.

## Routing headers

Only `X-Proxy-Base-URL` is required by the proxy. The upstream may require a key.
Routing validation and request construction live in
[request.go](../internal/proxy/request.go).

| Request header | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `X-Proxy-Base-URL` | Absolute HTTP(S) upstream base; no userinfo, query or fragment. |
| `X-Proxy-Key` | Upstream key; takes precedence over `Authorization`. Without it, a Bearer credential or the supplied Authorization value is used. No credential is also allowed. |
| `X-Proxy-Auth-Header` | Key's upstream header; defaults to `Authorization`. |
| `X-Proxy-Auth-Prefix` | Prefix before the key; defaults to `Bearer `. A present empty header selects no prefix. |
| `X-Proxy-Path` | Replace the incoming path before joining it to the base URL. |
| `X-Proxy-Query` | Nonempty query override; otherwise the incoming query is preserved. |
| `X-Proxy-Headers` | HTTP-relay header overrides as a JSON object of string arrays, e.g. `{"x-example-version":["2026-01"]}`. Not applied to model discovery or the Cursor bridge. |
| `X-Proxy-Timeout-Ms` | Positive per-send deadline expressed in milliseconds. Each attempt gets a fresh budget for headers and body; queue/hold/backoff waits do not consume it. |
| `X-Proxy-Format` | `openai` (also the default), `anthropic`, or `cursor`. See [adapters](adapters.md). |
| `X-Proxy-Client` | Observability/client label; otherwise inferred from client SDK/User-Agent metadata. |
| `X-Proxy-Session` | Explicit conversation ID; otherwise automatic grouping applies. |
| `X-Proxy-Parent-Session` | Direct declared parent; requires an explicit own session on the same request. |
| `X-Proxy-Max-Concurrency` | Positive provider-plus-key scheduler-group cap. Each admission updates the shared group's policy; later admissions, including headerless ones using config defaults, can replace it. Not the persistent provider-wide control. |
| `X-Proxy-Limit-Concurrency` | Sticky provider-wide in-flight cap. |
| `X-Proxy-Limit-Requests` | Sticky provider-wide request rate as `COUNT/WINDOW`. |
| `X-Proxy-Limit-Tokens` | Sticky provider-wide token rate as `COUNT/WINDOW`. |
| `X-Proxy-Refresh-Token` | Opt-in stateless expired-token refresh for supported mechanisms. See [refresh](adapters.md#token-refresh). |

One caller setting `X-Proxy-Limit-*` affects every key/client of that provider.
Absent headers preserve limits; `0`, `off`, `none` or `unlimited` clear them.
Windows accept Go durations from 1 second through 24 hours, plus `1d`.
Malformed limit values reject the request without applying any of its limit
headers. The Limits menu shows the policy and its source.

Supported proxy-control headers never forward upstream. Injected names must be
valid, unique case-insensitively, and not reserved control/hop-by-hop/Host names;
values must be valid HTTP field values. Ordinary hop-by-hop and
Connection-nominated headers are removed. Precedence depends on the request path:

| Path | Header precedence, lowest to highest |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP relay, including Anthropic translation | Forwarded values → extracted authentication → configured provider headers → explicit injection. Configured/injected authentication can override the extracted key. |
| HTTP model discovery | Constructed authentication → configured provider headers. Explicit injection is not applied. |
| Cursor run/model discovery | Configured headers → required protocol/framing headers and extracted authentication when a key is present. Explicit injection is not applied. |

The provider label is server-derived from the base host's registrable domain;
IPs retain their authority/port, and nonregistrable hostnames remain hostnames.
Optional provider aliases apply afterward. There is no supported
`X-Proxy-Provider` override.

## URL and auth examples

A base ending in `/v1` and request path `/v1/chat/completions` do not produce
`/v1/v1/chat/completions`: the join removes the shared leading segment.
A path override still joins to the selected base. Use `X-Proxy-Query` rather
than embedding a query in the base URL.

For a native Anthropic-compatible endpoint, use its documented base/model/key
and set translation plus the appropriate upstream auth/path/version headers:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Proxy-Base-URL: $NATIVE_BASE_URL" \
  -H "X-Proxy-Key: $NATIVE_API_KEY" \
  -H 'X-Proxy-Auth-Header: x-api-key' \
  -H 'X-Proxy-Auth-Prefix;' \
  -H 'X-Proxy-Path: /messages' \
  -H 'X-Proxy-Format: anthropic' \
  -H "X-Proxy-Headers: {\"anthropic-version\":[\"$NATIVE_API_VERSION\"]}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$NATIVE_MODEL\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hello\"}]}"
```

The example assumes JSON-safe model/version values. The semicolon in
`-H 'X-Proxy-Auth-Prefix;'` is important: curl sends a present empty header.
`-H 'X-Proxy-Auth-Prefix:'` instead omits it, leaving the proxy's Bearer default.
See the [official curl header guide](https://everything.curl.dev/http/modify/headers.html).
An unauthenticated local upstream needs no dummy API key.

## Relay, retries and model discovery

Ordinary requests preserve original body bytes, but the request is buffered up
to `max_request_bytes` before metadata extraction and sending. Invalid JSON is
passed through on the nontranslated path. The proxy can retry transient
transport failures, 429 and 5xx before returning the final response. Durable
quota/billing 429s are not treated as transient. Provider retry hints and
operator holds can substantially extend total wall time.

SSE pacing may insert comment keepalives. A known queue/hold wait may commit HTTP
200 before the final upstream outcome, so a subsequent failure must be signaled
in-band. Bounded terminal/quality handling can replace a degenerate completion
with an error. Non-streaming quality retries may make another upstream request;
neither transparency nor exactly-once upstream execution is unconditional.

`GET /v1/models` and `GET /models` are constructed discovery services, not
ordinary inference records. The proxy normalizes recognized model lists,
translates native formats, completes supported pagination, and optionally
enriches missing fields. Unrecognized successful list bodies remain verbatim;
primary discovery budget/errors fail explicitly, while optional enrichment can
fall back to the complete base list. Discovery can apply limit headers without
consuming an inference slot. Its time/byte/page limits are configuration-owned.

The proxy returns upstream redirects rather than following them. Forwarding
also changes transport headers and may decompress an upstream gzip response;
do not compare transport framing as a byte-identical contract.

## Main and sub-conversations

A parent sends `X-Proxy-Session: main-task`. Its child sends its own
`X-Proxy-Session: worker-1` plus `X-Proxy-Parent-Session: main-task`, using the
same client label and API key. Send IDs without the stored `s:` prefix.

When declaring a parent, both headers must occur once, contain nonempty valid
UTF-8 without controls, differ from each other, and fit 512 bytes after trimming.
Self-parent/invalid declarations return 400. The parent header is proxy-only;
it neither edits the body nor instructs an upstream to create a child agent.

The server resolves observed relationships within
`(client, key_hash, conversation_id)`, including history outside the selected
view. The explorer reports main/sub/unresolved counts and role/parent metadata.
A missing parent is **not observed**, not an invented main. Conflicts, cycles or
ambiguous reused IDs remain unresolved. “Main” means no parent declared in
observed history, not independently verified orchestration.

Parent links preserve the full representable client/key namespace. Conversation
filters remain exact leaves, never descendant filters. A changed credential can
change the namespace. Historical parentage cannot be inferred from absent data,
message similarity, or ordinary conversation-continuity fields.
